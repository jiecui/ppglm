# Forecasting over days

This is the companion code for the article:
Proix T, Truccolo W, Leguia M, King-Stephens D, Rao V, Baud M (2021). Forecasting seizure risk in adults with focal epilepsy: a development and validation study. The Lancet Neurology, 20(1):127-135. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30396-3

### Installation:
Software:

- R.utils 2.10.1
- feather 0.3.5
- pracma 2.3.3
- ncdf4 1.17
- reshape2 1.4.4

### Content
